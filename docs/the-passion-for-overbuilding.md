# The passion for overbuilding 

As a software developer I suffer from my unintentional passion for *overbuilding*, also known as *overengineering*. It feels like the more you know about technologies and things they can do, the further you can get in dreaming about your perfect product.

What drives the *overbuilding*?

- **Perfectionism**. You want everything to be well architected right from the start and be ready for the scaling to millions of users.
- **Wide set of developer tools currently available**. With a wide selection of free tools, components and frameworks you can easily turn every *Hello, World* into an app that requires dozens of packages to be installed.
- **Not knowing the history of great product**. Almost all great and polished products were really crappy at the beginning. 
- **Myth of super programmers**. Super programmers are some programmers who are able to write beautiful, working and final code right away and do it all 100 times faster. Every programmer wants to become one.
- **Avoiding interactions with end-users**. There is a fear that final end-users won’t like your product before it is ideal. Also, interactions with real end-users can be painful because it may turn out they don't need your current product at all.
- **Not seeing enough great products died** because they were not bringing enough value to their users or got a little traction.
- **Not seeing enough crappy products** that are successful because they are delivering actual value to their users even with ugly UI and sloppy internal design.
- **Turning every problem into a platform or a marketplace**. Engineers love frameworks but it is not a good idea to build a platform first. For example: "*I have an idea for a photo effects app*" -> "*well, let’s make a platform for photo effects apps*" -> “*but first, let’s make our own framework for platforms for photo effects apps*”. Platforms are hard. Marketplaces are even harder.
