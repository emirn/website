# The passion for overbuilding 

As a software developer I suffer from my unintentional passion for *overbuilding*, also known as *overengineering*. It feels like the more you know about technologies and things they can do, the further you can get in dreaming about your perfect product.

What drives the *overbuilding*?

- **Perfectionism**. You want everything to be well architected right from the start and be ready for the scaling to millions of users.
- **Wide set of developer tools currently available**. With a wide selection of free tools, components and frameworks you can easily turn every *Hello, World* into an app that requires dozens of packages to be installed.
- **Not knowing the history of great product**. Almost all great and polished products were really crappy at the beginning. 
- **Myth of super programmers**, who are able to write beautiful, working and final code right away.
- **Avoiding interactions with end-users** as long as you can because there is a fear that they won’t like something. 
- **Not seeing enough great products died** because they were not bringing enough value to their users or got a little traction.
- **Not seeing enough crappy products** that are successful because they are delivering actual value to their users even with ugly UI and sloppy internal design.
- **The inclination to turn every problem into a platforms or a marketplace*. For example: "I have an idea for a photo effects app" -> "well, let’s make a platform for photo effects apps" -> “but first, let’s make our own framework for platforms for photo effects apps”. Platforms are hard. Marketplaces are even harder.
