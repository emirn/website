# Where to buy (or sell) a startup 

## Why buy a startup

If you want to run a startup then you can create a brand new startup or you can actually buy and grow one.

There are few successful stories on the Internet about buying a project and successfully growing it:

- Rob Walling's [experience](https://robwalling.com/2015/12/02/what-i-learned-buying-growing-and-selling-hittail/) with buying and growing _HitTail_ online service
- Nathan Latka's [story](https://medium.com/@nathanlatka/how-i-got-95-net-profit-margins-on-a-chrome-extension-20fdcfc1f754) about buying and monetizing _SndLatr_ Chrome plugin. 
- Also, there are so called "_search funds_" that are similar to venture funds but instead of investing into startups, these funds are focused on buying companies for the purpose of growing and expanding them under new management.

# Where startups are looking for feedback.

In addition to marketplaces, there are few places where startup founders and entrepreneurs are looking for feedback about their new businesses. Some of them may also look for new users and for potential buyers. Here are the few of them:

*   [Reddit Side Projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) - the Reddit community where entrepreneurs are showcasing their side projects and startups.

I've created a small side aggregator with filters. It automatically gathers posts from some of the mentioned sources above.
